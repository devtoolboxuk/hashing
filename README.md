## Background

Although there are many hashing services out there, I decided to create a basic one for use on some of my projects.

The Unit Tests have been run on PHP 7.2, but the code will happily run on PHP 5.4 (for all of those legacy projects still out there.)

## Usage

Usage of the hashing service

```sh
$ composer require devtoolboxuk/Hashing
```

Then include Composer's generated vendor/autoload.php to enable autoloading:

```sh
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

```sh
use devtoolboxuk/Hashing;

$this->hashingService = new HashingService();
```


##### Set Hashing Key
```sh
$this->hashingService->setHashingKey($key);
```

##### Get Hashing key
```sh 
$this->hashingKey = $this->hashingService->getHashingKey();
```

##### Hashing Data
Pass in the data to be hashed.
```sh
$this->hashingService->hash("Test Data");
```

##### Get Hashed Data
Returns the hash of the data.
```sh
$this->hashingService->getHashedData()
```


By default, the Hashing service uses the SHA256 Algoritm, and the HMAC Hashing Function

##### Retrieve Hashed Data
```sh
$this->hashingService->setHashingKey($key);
$this->hashingKey = $this->hashingService->getHashingKey();
```

The algorithm for hashing can be changed using this function, currently only the following algorithms are supported; 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha512', 'md5'

##### Set Algorithm
```sh
$this->hashingService->setHashingKey($key);
$this->hashingKey = $this->hashingService->getHashingKey();
```

The hashing function can also be changed to use either hmac or not (others may come along...)


##### Set Hashing Function
```sh
$this->hashingService->setHashFunction('hmac');
```
